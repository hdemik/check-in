# Check-in

A random question displayed in a nice green setting. Done.

Visit https://damp-thicket-68463.herokuapp.com/ for an example.

Use `/today` for a question that is fixed to the current day.

Try `/!/10` or any other number below 17 to find a fixed question
for sharing on social media.

If you want a JSON reply, just ask for it:

```
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" https://damp-thicket-68463.herokuapp.com/
```

Add "?lang=(en|de|nl)" to your query in order to get a check-in question
in the language of your choice, both in JSON and web
